# Arduino-Python-Facial-Recognition-Control

## Dataset
This project uses a facial recognition model trained using Teachable Machine to identify whether a face is present. The model is used to control an LED light through Arduino.

## Project Steps

1. **Train the Facial Recognition Model:**
   - Go to [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).
   - Create a new image model with two classes:
     - Class 1: Your face (upload multiple pictures).
     - Class 2: Other faces/no face (or background images).
   - Export the model in TensorFlow/Keras format.

2. **Upload Arduino Code:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and upload the basic code that listens for commands from Python to control the LED light.

3. **Set Up Python-Arduino Communication:**
   - Install the required Python libraries using `pip install pyserial tensorflow opencv-python`.
   - Use Python to send serial signals to the Arduino. When the model detects your face, it sends a signal to turn on the green LED. When no face is detected, it turns on the red LED.

4. **Test the System:**
   - Train and test your facial recognition model.
   - Test the communication between Python and Arduino to ensure the LED control works based on face detection.

5. **Refine the Model (if needed):**
   - Adjust the facial recognition modelâ€™s sensitivity if required.
   - Ensure that the system behaves as expected during runtime.
